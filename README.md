# File-Level Documentation
The game consists of 2 levels:

1. Level 0

    Consists of the usual Flappy Bird gameplay, wherein the player has to avoid hitting various sets of plastic pipes.

2. Level 1

    Consists of an additional steel pipe type which shoots flames and of a set of weapons the player can utilise. 

    Rocks can only hit plastic pipes while bombs can hit any pipe type. Both weapons have limited shooting ranges.
