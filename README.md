# ShadowFlap

This project is an imitation of Flappy Bird using the Bagel package as discussed below.

It has two levels:  

Level 0 consists of the usual Flappy Bird gameplay, wherein the player has to avoid hitting various sets of plastic pipes.

Level 1 consists of an additional steel pipe type which shoots flames and of a set of weapons the player can utilise. 
Rocks can only hit plastic pipes while bombs can hit any pipe type. Both weapons have limited shooting ranges.
